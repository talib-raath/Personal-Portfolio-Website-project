            <h1>Local Business Website</h1>
            <p> Since working with smaller businesss is the easiest way to get your foot in the door and build a
                 solid client<br> base, you’ll definitely want to include a design or redesign of a local non-profit 
                 or neighborhood business in <br>your portfolio to show potential clients.

                Take a stab at redesigning your favorite family-own restaurant’s site.<br> See if you can give it a 
                completly modern feel with CSS and Adobe Photoshop banish Flash intros and Comic<br> Sans font — 
                while staying true to the business’ identity.
                
                There’s nothing holding you back — except for a few <br>critical freelancer  rules that you  need to 
                keep in mind.....
                First, make surre that  the  product  associated with the<br> business you choose is the kind of product
                 you want to be associated with — in other words, ask yourself if <br>your prospective will want to be aligned 
                 with the type of client or concept products you’re presenting.
   
                That <br>redesign of “Crazy T’s Ammo Depot” might look cool, but it’s not necessarily going to go over with all audie<br>nces. 
                
                Second — and this is critical but easy to overlook — make sure your small business is the kind of thing <br>you  can find good 
                stock photos for. Photography makes a huge impact on websites, especially e-commerce <br> websites, so think ahead.</p>

            <h1>Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>
            <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the paper-and-pencil gamaes. This game requires two players in 3x3 grid
                 with Player 1 acts <br> as “O”  and Player 2 acts as “X”, or vice versa (Figure 1). The objective 
                 of this game is to take 
                place of three conne  <br> cting
                 grids in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal way/fork

            <h1>Ball Breaking</h1>
            <p>A breaking ball is more difficult than a straight pitch for a catcher to receive as breaking pitches sometimes hit the <br> ground 
                (whether intentionally, or not) before making it to the plate. A curveaball moves down and to the left for a <br>right handed pitcher.
                 For a left hand pitcher, it moves down and to the right.[1] And blocking a breaking ball requi<br>res thought and preparation by the 
                 catcher.The pitcher then, must have confidence in the catcher, and the catcher<br>  in himself, to block any ball in the dirt; if there
                  are runners on base, they will likly advance if the ball gets away from<br>  the catcher. (Whether the pitcher is right- or left-handed
                   will dictate which direction the catcher must turn his body <br> to adjust for the spin
                 of an upcoming breaking ball. This necessary movement may reveal the next intended pitch to <br> the batter; therefore an experienced catcher
                  must fake or mask his intentions when preparing for the pitch.</p>
